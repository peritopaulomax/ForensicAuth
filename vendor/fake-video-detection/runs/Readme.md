# General
Contains all runs that we have done throughout the project as tensorboard files.
To view the runs, simply start tensorboard via:

`tensorboard --logdir path/to/runs`

# Naming conventions

- <b>Baseline (trained by Lukas):</b> results from the model `networks/baseline.py`
- <b>TemporalEncoderII (trained by Lukas):</b> results from the model `networks/temporal_encoder_network.py` either <b>with our without</b> warp
- <b>TE small (trained by Anna):</b> results from the model `networks/temporal_encoder_small.py` and `networks/warp_model_small.py`
- <b>Optical Flow (trained by Anna):</b> results from several optical flow models in the following subdirectries
    - Names containing <b>just\_of:</b> model `networks/network_just_of.py` 
    - Names containing <b>of\_fc:</b> model `networks/network_of_fc.py`
    - Names containing <b>of\_conv:</b> model `networks/network_of_conv.py`

Each run has a unique identifier as folder name. This identifier can also be used to load the corresponding model, if it was saved in `saved_results/models`.

# Matching of run-id's to numbers in the report
Here we provide a list, which runs contain results that are mentioned in our report. Other runs not mentioned in this list were done by us e.g. for hyperparameter tuning, debugging, etc. but are still left in the repository for future reference. Sometimes, we mention multiple run-id's per method, this is because we had to restart the jupyter notebook before doing testing sometimes.

## Tables 1 and 2 in report (runs by Lukas)
Here we list run-id's for training of the baseline and temporal encoder (with and without warp).
The models were trained on one single fake method + original videos with the configuration: 100 videos, 5 sequences, 10 frames, skip rate 5.

## Hyperparameter tuning from Table 3 (runs by Lukas)
Here we show the results of testing different values of the delta_t parameter and for the skip rate. We tested it on the temporal encoder model. The model was trained on one single fake method (deepfake) + original videos with the configuration: 100 videos, 5 sequences, 10 frames, skip rate 5. The different hyperparameters can be found in the `HPARAMS` tab in tensorboard. All runs for the hyperparameter tuning are listed below.

## Optical Flow Results from Table 2 (runs by Anna)
The final results using optical flow can be found in directory `OpticalFlow/test_results_of_conv`.

## Optical Flow Configurations from Table 4 (runs by Anna)
The runs corresponding to results in the table comparing different frame pairings for optical flow calculation can be found in directory `OpticalFlow/of_fc_config_tests`.

## Results for Optical Flow Representation not contained in the report (runs by Anna)
Comparisons for different representation of the Optical Flow using the components (x, y, magnitude, angle) can be found in directory `OpticalFlow/of_conv_compare_components`.

## Results not contained in the report but in past presentations (runs by Anna & Lukas)
Some results from past presentations can be found in directory `TE_small`. Some results in all directories that are not mentioned in the list above are results that we used for training, debugging, etc. and are included in the repository for future reference nonetheless.
